   Yes, this is how to execute statement1 when A and B are false and C is true.

61. (A^B)
| A | B | A^B | If Percival is the liar then it would be impossible for Llewellyn to be telling the truth
| T | T |  T  | or lying. Therefore, Percival is telling the truth. Percival is telling the truth and

62. (A->B)
| A | B | A->B | Merlin is saying that if she is a truth-teller then Meredith is a truth-teller, which can

| T | F |   F  | teller.

63. (AvB)
| A | B | AvB | Rothwold says he is a liar or Grymlin is a truth-teller. If he is lying about Grymlin being
| T | T |  T  | a truth teller then his first statement saying he is a liar would be true, which would make
| T | F |  T  | him a truth-teller because one of the statements is true. Since he is telling the truth and
| F | T |  T  | his first statement is false, that must mean his second statement is true about Grymlin. Rothwold
| F | F |  F  | and Grymlin are both truth-tellers.

64. A = liar | (AvA')
| A | AvA' | Gwendolin is a truth-teller because if she is lying it means she is telling the truth about her being
